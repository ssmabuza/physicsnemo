r"""Integration tests for plain-tensor auto-promotion.

When a plain ``torch.Tensor`` (e.g. an all-gathered / replicated model weight)
meets a sharded ``ShardTensor`` inside an intercepted op, ``ShardTensor``
auto-promotes it to a ``Replicate`` distributed tensor on the sharded
argument's mesh. These tests verify the three ``TensorPromotionMode`` behaviors
(``WARN`` warns, ``SILENT`` is quiet, ``DISABLED`` refuses to mix) and that the
promoted computation is numerically correct.

These tests require multiple GPUs (``--multigpu-static``).
