"""Mesh remeshing and cell partitioning.

This module provides two complementary algorithms for mesh coarsening:

**Cell partitioning** (:func:`partition_cells`):
    Assigns each cell of a fine mesh to its nearest seed point (by Euclidean
    centroid distance) and accumulates area, normal, and centroid per cluster.
    This is a single-step discrete approximation to the restricted Voronoi
    diagram on the surface.  Pure PyTorch, no external dependencies.

**Surface remeshing** (:func:`remesh`):
    Creates new triangle topology on CPU or CUDA using Warp. Selected point
    data can be interpolated onto the result, and a direct or attached positive
    field can control local resolution.

``partition_cells`` is also a natural building block for a pure-PyTorch
centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT): Lloyd's algorithm iterates from
partitioning to moving seeds to cluster centroids, then repeats.

Example:
    >>> from physicsnemo.mesh.primitives.surfaces import sphere_icosahedral
    >>> from physicsnemo.mesh.remeshing import remesh
    >>> mesh = sphere_icosahedral.load(subdivisions=3)
    >>> # Remesh a triangle mesh to approximately 100 vertices
    >>> remeshed = remesh(mesh, n_clusters=100)
    >>> assert remeshed.n_cells > 0
