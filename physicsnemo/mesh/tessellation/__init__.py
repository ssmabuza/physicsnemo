"""Tessellation: decompose non-simplicial cells into a simplex mesh.

Exposes :func:`triangulate`, which converts a polygon soup (an ``Adjacency`` of
cell-to-vertex rings) into a triangle connectivity, staying correct for
non-convex polygons. It branches on manifold dimension and currently implements
the 2D (polygon -> triangle) case.

Also exposes exact-boundary quality mesh *generation* (which inserts new
points, unlike :func:`triangulate`'s pure decomposition):
:func:`fill_interior` takes a closed codimension-one boundary ``Mesh`` (edge
loops in 2D) and fills the enclosed interior with quality simplices through
constrained Delaunay triangulation with Ruppert refinement. The algorithm
preserves every input vertex bit-identically, and in 2D every output angle
meets the requested bound. :func:`polygon_interior_point`
returns a point strictly inside a simple polygon.
