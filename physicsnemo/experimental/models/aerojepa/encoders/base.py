class BaseContextEncoder(Module, ABC):
    r"""Abstract base class for context encoders.

    A context encoder ingests the geometry-side input and produces an
    :class:`EncoderOutput` carrying context tokens plus an optional global
    token. ``context_pos`` bundles whatever positions the model is
    configured to ingest — for surface-only models this is the boundary
    only; for whole-domain models it is ``cat(boundary_pos,
    volumetric_sample_pos)`` and an SDF channel in ``context_feat``
    distinguishes the two halves.

    Subclasses must implement :meth:`forward`. The :meth:`forward_batched`
    path is optional — concrete encoders that support padded batched
    inputs override it and set ``supports_batched_forward = True`` on the
    class.

            Padded context positions of shape ``(B, N, 3)``.

class BaseTargetEncoder(Module, ABC):
    r"""Abstract base class for target encoders.

    A target encoder runs at training time and produces the supervision
    target for the predictor head. Unlike the context encoder, it sees the
    surface and volume halves of the input *separately*: training-time
    subsampling for the two is intentionally decoupled (different point
    counts, different tokenization strategies are allowed).

    At inference, the target encoder is generally bypassed — only its
    tokenizer is reused (via the model's
    ``_build_target_token_coords`` helper) to recover the spatial
    coordinates of every target token.

    Subclasses must implement :meth:`forward`. The :meth:`forward_batched`
    path is optional.
