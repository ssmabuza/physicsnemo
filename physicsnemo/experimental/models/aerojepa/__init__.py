"""AeroJEPA model and its model-specific subcomponents (experimental).

The :class:`AeroJEPA` model composes a context encoder, a target encoder,
a predictor head, a trunk that wires the encoders and decoder together,
and a query-based field decoder. All five pieces live in this subpackage
(the encoders under ``aerojepa.encoders``). The building blocks the model
is built from — attention blocks, the point-cloud tokenizer, the Fourier
positional encoding, token dataclasses, and the batching/mask/k-NN
helpers — live alongside the model in ``aerojepa.layers``.

API stability: experimental. Names and signatures may change between
releases until the design graduates out of ``physicsnemo.experimental``.
