# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-XX-YY

### Added

- Adds `physicsnemo.datapipes.keys` and routes every config-driven field name
  in `physicsnemo.datapipes` through it, so a `"."` in a YAML field name
  (`"solution.pressure"`) addresses a leaf inside a nested `TensorDict`.
  Nested `Mesh` data no longer needs to be flattened before use.

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

- Datapipe transforms, collators, readers, and the unified external aero
  recipe no longer silently skip or mis-handle nested `TensorDict` fields
  (membership was tested against top-level `td.keys()`, and
  `NormalizeMeshFields.inverse_td` matched leaves by their last name only).
- `from_pyvista` / `to_pyvista` round-trip nested `Mesh` data keys, and GLOBE
  accepts a nested `global_data_ranks` declaration.
- Fixes out-of-bounds reads in the `Darcy2D` multi-grid solver for
  `nr_multigrids >= 3` that could return huge or NaN pressure fields, and
  corrects the coarse-node coordinates used by bilinear upsampling for
  reduction factors greater than 2.

### Security

### Dependencies

## [2.2.1] - 2026-XX-YY

### Fixed

- Allows installation on all Python 3.14 patch releases while continuing to
  exclude Python 3.15 and later.
- Pins install CI to the interpreter provisioned by `setup-python` and verifies
  the runtime version, preventing `uv` from silently selecting another Python.
- Keeps tensorclass mesh API annotations introspectable under Python 3.14's
  deferred annotation evaluation.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Adds `ShardTensor` support for GeoTransolver and FLARE models.
- Adds zarr save/load for `Mesh` and `DomainMesh` via tensordict's zarr
  storage backend: `physicsnemo.mesh.io.to_zarr` / `from_zarr`, with
  training-appropriate chunking and zstd compression. `MeshReader` and
  `DomainMeshReader` transparently read zarr stores alongside
  `.pmsh`/`.pdmsh` (opt in via `pattern`). Requires optional `zarr >= 3`
  and a tensordict release with the zarr backend.
- Adds configurable activation checkpointing to Transolver, FLARE, and
  GeoTransolver. Transolver and FLARE support interleaved block checkpointing;
  GeoTransolver supports checkpointing context construction, per-stream input
  projections, GALE or GALE_FA blocks, and output projections.
- Promotes GeoTransolver out of `experimental` to
  `physicsnemo.models.geotransolver.GeoTransolver`, together with the FLARE
  model (`physicsnemo.models.flare.FLARE`) and the reusable GALE and FLARE
  attention layers (`physicsnemo.nn.GALE`, `physicsnemo.nn.GALEBlock`,
  `physicsnemo.nn.FLARE`). The embedded OOD guard is decoupled from the model.
  Wrap a constructed GeoTransolver with
  `physicsnemo.experimental.guardrails.embedded.GuardedGeoTransolver` (or
  `attach_ood_guard`) to enable out-of-distribution guarding. PhysicsNeMo removes
  the  `guard_config` model argument. Legacy import shims keep the pre-move
  `physicsnemo.experimental` import paths working and emit a
  `LegacyFeatureWarning` pointing to the new locations.
- Adds `zenith_azimuth_angles` and `zenith_azimuth_angles_from_timestamp` to
  `physicsnemo.utils.zenith_angle`, returning
  `(sin_zenith, cos_zenith, sin_azimuth, cos_azimuth)` alongside the existing
  `cos_zenith_angle` / `cos_zenith_angle_from_timestamp` helpers. The azimuth
  follows the north-clockwise convention.
- Adds `physicsnemo.nn.shrink_and_perturb_`, an in-place shrink-and-perturb
  weight re-initialization for warm-starting from pretrained weights.
- Adds dimension-generic volume mesh generation for implicit domains to
  `physicsnemo.mesh.generate`. `mesh_implicit_domain` meshes
  `{x : phi(x) < 0}`, clipped to the bounding box (box faces are honored
  as a boundary, so that external-flow "box minus obstacle" domains work
  directly), for any implicit function (signed-distance functions, level
  sets, or neural fields).
- Adds compile-safe subclassing extension points to `domain_parallel.ShardTensor`
  (`_extra_inner_tensors`, `__subclass_flatten_context__` / `__subclass_unflatten__`,
  `_stable_inner_sentinel`, and a DTensor-style `__metadata_guard__`), so a subclass can
  carry extra inner tensors and opaque metadata through `torch.compile` without
  re-implementing the flatten protocol. Base behavior unchanged.
- Adds `ShardTensor._subclass_propagated_attrs`: attribute names base `__torch_function__`
  copies from an op input onto its eager op-result, re-classing it to the subclass. Skipped
  under compile; empty by default.
- Adds `install_aot_plain_tangent_coercion` (run on import): rebuilds a plain backward
  cotangent into a `ShardTensor` when a boundary crosses a Dynamo graph break, instead of
  AOTAutograd raising "guessed its metadata incorrectly". `__coerce_same_metadata_as_tangent__`
  now also coerces down to a plain tensor at a replicated boundary.
- Adds `domain_parallel.shard_utils.halo_scatter`: a `torch.compile`-safe halo
  scatter-correction primitive for `Shard(0)` ShardTensors with a borrowed-ghost overlay.
  `halo_scatter_correct` fuses the fold-to-owner / refresh-ghost exchanges into a self-adjoint
  `custom_op` (correct forward and backward under `aot_eager` and inductor), with routing
  passed as a packed graph-input tensor so it survives graph breaks;
  `register_halo_scatter_handlers` wires it onto `scatter_add` / `index_add`. The row
  transport is a pluggable backend (`select_halo_backend`, `PHYSICSNEMO_HALO_BACKEND`):
  a portable `funcol` path and an intra-node symmetric-memory (CUDA-IPC) path.
- Extends `halo_scatter` with `pack_halo_routing(cap=)` fixed-shape routing (for compiled
  `dynamic=False` runs), an in-place `scatter_add_` / `index_add_` dispatch handler, and
  node-locality routing in `select_halo_backend` (single-node uses symm-mem, multi-node falls
  back to `funcol`).
- Adds a `ShardTensor.grad_dtype` property override (returns the local tensor's dtype)
  so a newer-PyTorch `grad_dtype` read during Dynamo fake conversion doesn't fall back
  to a non-leaf DTensor and break compile. Mirrors the `grad_fn` / `is_leaf` / `grad`
  shields.
- Adds `integrate_moment` and `Mesh.integrate_moment` for measure-weighted
  outer-product moments. Mesh integration APIs now accept `nan_policy`.
- Adds per-cell measure weights that are preserved through cell subsampling
  and consumed by mesh integration routines and GLOBE.
- Adds a `global_shape` argument to `ShardTensor.from_local`, enabling the
  no-communication `sharding_shapes="chunk"` path.
- Adds exact-boundary quality mesh generation to
  `physicsnemo.mesh.tessellation`: `fill_interior` takes a closed
  codimension-one boundary `Mesh` (2D edge loops today; loops in any order
  and orientation, with holes, multiple components, and nested islands
  resolved automatically) and fills the interior with quality simplices via
  constrained Delaunay triangulation with Ruppert refinement — every input
  vertex is preserved bit-identically, every output triangle meets the
  guaranteed minimum-angle bound, output is a `Mesh` with provenance
  `point_data`, deterministic, with optional bound-preserving ODT smoothing.
  The contract is dimension-generic; `n = 3` raises `NotImplementedError`
  pending exact boundary recovery. Also adds `polygon_interior_point`,
  which returns a point strictly inside a simple polygon.
- Adds `rectilinear_grid_divergence`, `rectilinear_grid_curl`, and
  `rectilinear_grid_laplacian` to `physicsnemo.nn.functional`, with Torch and
  fused Warp implementations for periodic, nonuniform rectilinear grids.
- Adds triangle-surface remeshing with NVIDIA Warp on CPU and CUDA, including
  `remesh`, `Mesh.remesh`, topology cleanup, barycentric point-data transfer,
  direct or attached linear-resolution-field control, and advanced tensor-level
  tuning.
- Adds coverage reporting on PRs — an informational `Coverage %` check plus a
  ready-to-enable Codecov integration.
- Adds differentiable mesh morphing: Torch-backed dense ``displace_points`` /
  ``Mesh.displace`` and Torch/NVIDIA Warp compact sparse-control
  ``morph_points`` / ``Mesh.morph`` / ``DomainMesh.morph``.
- Adds differentiable Sobolev mesh deformation through
  `sobolev_deform_points` and `Mesh.sobolev_deform`. A matrix-free,
  uniform-mass P1 Helmholtz solve smooths dense per-vertex displacements and
  their adjoints, with optional fixed-point constraints. Torch and CUDA Warp
  backends provide explicit implicit-adjoint differentiation.
- Adds thin-plate-spline radial-basis deformation through
  `radial_basis_function_deform_points`,
  `Mesh.radial_basis_function_deform`, and
  `DomainMesh.radial_basis_function_deform`. PyTorch performs the differentiable
  coefficient solve. Torch and fused NVIDIA Warp backends evaluate the field.
- Adds differentiable lattice free-form deformation with Torch and NVIDIA Warp
  backends: dimension-generic ``free_form_deform_points`` /
  ``Mesh.free_form_deform`` / ``DomainMesh.free_form_deform`` with Bernstein
  (classic FFD) and locally supported uniform cubic B-spline bases, plus
  node-interpolating `linear`, `cubic_hermite`, and `quintic_hermite` modes.
- Adds fixed-topology ``simplex_strain_energy``, ``simplex_measure_energy``,
  ``total_measure_energy``, ``simplex_inversion_energy``,
  ``closed_surface_volume_energy``, and ``surface_bending_energy`` to
  ``physicsnemo.nn.functional``, with mesh-aware wrappers in
  ``physicsnemo.mesh.deformation``. Torch supports higher-order derivatives,
  and Warp provides first-order GPU kernels.
- Adds differentiable nearest-surface shrinkwrap through
  `shrinkwrap_points` and `Mesh.shrinkwrap`. Torch provides the reference
  search, NVIDIA Warp accelerates ``float32`` nearest-face queries on CPU and
  CUDA. Both backends replay the selected projection with PyTorch autograd.
  Triangulated examples demonstrate weighted panel conformance and partial
  design-region projection onto a shape-optimization constraint.
- Adds `uniform_grid_divergence`, `uniform_grid_curl`, and
  `uniform_grid_laplacian` to `physicsnemo.nn.functional`, with Torch and fused
  Warp implementations for periodic Cartesian grids.
- Adds the experimental Strata weather-emulation models —
  `physicsnemo.experimental.models.strata.Strata` and `StrataTransformer3D` — plus
  the continuous / stereographic RoPE helpers `build_rope_cos_sin_1d_continuous`,
  `build_axial_rope_cos_sin_2d_continuous`, `stereographic_projection`, and
  `spherical_centroid` in `physicsnemo.experimental.nn`.
- Adds Point-Transformer local vector-attention blocks to `physicsnemo.nn`.
- Adds an `is_causal` option to `TimmSelfAttention` in `physicsnemo.nn` for
  causal self-attention.
- FSDP2 checkpoint support: full save/load round-trip for
  ``torch.distributed.fsdp`` v2 models, including DTensor edge cases,
  cross-mesh reloads, and optimizer state loading.
- Migrated the StormCast example from DDP + Domain Parallel  to FSDP2 +
  Domain Parallel. StormCast previously used ``FullyShardedDataParallel``
  with ``ShardingStrategy.NO_SHARD`` (equivalent to DDP) alongside domain
  parallelism; it now uses the FSDP2 ``fully_shard`` API, producing 2D-mesh
  DTensor parameters when ``use_shard_tensor`` is enabled.
- Adds tensor-returning `Mesh.gradient`, `Mesh.divergence`, `Mesh.curl`, and
  `Mesh.laplacian` convenience methods to `physicsnemo.mesh`, mirroring
  `Mesh.integrate` (each returns a tensor and accepts a data key or a raw
  tensor, with a `data_source="points"|"cells"` kwarg selecting vertex or
  cell-centered fields). This gives the discrete differential operators a
  consistent, discoverable surface on `Mesh`; previously divergence/curl/
  laplacian were reachable only as free functions in `physicsnemo.mesh.calculus`.
  Adds `compute_divergence_cells_lsq` and `compute_curl_cells_lsq` free
  functions (cell-centered LSQ analogues); DEC operators and the cotangent
  Laplacian remain vertex-only and raise `NotImplementedError` for cell data.
- Adds `farthest_point_sampling` to `physicsnemo.nn.functional`, a greedy
  farthest-point sampling (FPS) functional for point clouds.
- Adds `FourierPositionalEmbedding` to `physicsnemo.nn`, a deterministic
  axis-wise (NeRF-style) Fourier positional embedding for continuous
  coordinates with no learnable parameters.
- Adds radiation transport example (`examples/nuclear_engineering/radiation_transport`)
- Adds agent skills structure, and initial skill for 'discoverability'.
- Adds the experimental AeroJEPA model
  (`physicsnemo.experimental.models.aerojepa.AeroJEPA`), a joint-embedding
  predictive architecture for 3D aerodynamic fields composing context and
  target encoders, a query-token field decoder, and a JEPA predictor head,
  together with its SIGReg, token-latent, and reconstruction loss family.
  The generic point-cloud tokenizer and the batch/mask/k-NN helpers are added
  under `physicsnemo.experimental.nn`; the local point-transformer attention
  blocks it composes come from `physicsnemo.nn`.
- Adds the AeroJEPA SuperWing tutorial recipe
  (`examples/cfd/external_aerodynamics/aerojepa`), an end-to-end Hydra-driven
  workflow covering dataset download, normalization, JEPA training, chunked
  inference, field-error plots, and CL/CD post-processing.
- Adds xDeepONet to experimental models
  (`physicsnemo.experimental.models.xdeeponet.DeepONet`).  A single
  dimension-generic (2D/3D) DeepONet that accepts a spatial or MLP branch,
  an optional trunk, and an optional second branch as `nn.Module` inputs
  (dependency injection).  Six forward-call conventions cover trunked,
  trunkless, packed/auto-padded, and xFNO-style time-axis-extend modes.
  Supports multi-channel output, multiple decoder types (MLP, Conv,
  temporal projection), composable Fourier / UNet / Conv spatial branches
  (`SpatialBranch`), and coordinate features.
- Adds `FNO4DWrapper` to the xdeeponet package: a thin wrapper around the
  library `physicsnemo.models.fno.FNO` (`dimension=4`) that adds
  autoregressive time-axis extension over `(B, X, Y, Z, T, C)` inputs (predict
  a `K`-step forecast horizon via `target_times`).  Use
  `physicsnemo.models.fno.FNO(dimension=4)` directly when the time-axis
  extension is not needed.  3D FNO / Conv-FNO / U-FNO operators are expressed
  as `DeepONet(trunk=None, dimension=3)` with a Fourier/UNet/Conv
  `SpatialBranch`.
- Adds `Sin` elementwise sine activation to `physicsnemo.nn`, registered
  in `ACT2FN` so it can be looked up by name (`get_activation("sin")`).
- Adds active-learning recipe for external-aerodynamics surrogates
  (`examples/cfd/external_aerodynamics/active_learning_aero/`). Iteratively
  fine-tunes a GP-augmented GeoTransolver onto an out-of-distribution
  target class by scoring unlabeled candidates with a joint UQ signal
  (GP-vs-integrated-drag disagreement + GP posterior std) and selecting
  the top-`k` per round. Built on the `physicsnemo.active_learning`
  protocols and `physicsnemo.experimental.uq.VariationalGPHead`, with a
  layered structure (generic AL driver / GP-UQ recipe / aero adapter)
  designed for reuse on other UQ-based regression problems.
- Adds `FieldVariationalGPHead` to `physicsnemo.experimental.uq`, a pointwise
  independent multitask variational GP head for per-point, multi-channel *field*
  uncertainty. It is the field sibling of `VariationalGPHead` (which pools a
  geometry to one embedding and predicts a scalar): it keeps the point dimension
  and returns one Gaussian posterior per point per channel, so a single forward
  pass yields the field prediction, the total predictive variance and the
  epistemic-only variance — no ensembling or MC-Dropout. Backbone-agnostic (it
  consumes only a `(..., input_dim)` feature tensor), with an optional DKL MLP,
  a Matérn ARD kernel (5/2 by default), float64 GP internals, an `l2_radial` feature
  normalization that preserves the radial out-of-distribution cue, and an
  optional heteroscedastic observation-noise MLP. Includes a surface field-GP
  training recipe for GeoTransolver
  (`examples/cfd/external_aerodynamics/transformer_models/src/train_field_gp.py`).
- Adds a `return_point_features` forward flag to
  `physicsnemo.models.geotransolver.GeoTransolver`, which additionally returns
  the per-point latents computed just before the output projection. These are
  the features a pointwise head such as `FieldVariationalGPHead` consumes.
- Adds `LatentNoveltyQueryStrategy` to the active-learning aero recipe,
  a third acquisition strategy that ranks unlabeled samples by their
  average kNN cosine distance in the encoder's learned geometry latent
  — reusing the same `OODGuard`
  (`physicsnemo.experimental.guardrails.embedded`) that flags
  out-of-distribution inputs at inference time. The guard is calibrated
  on the currently labeled set each round; round 1 falls back to
  class-balanced random because the calibration buffer is empty. New
  public `OODGuard.score_geometry()` method exposes the raw per-sample
  geometry-latent kNN distance as a continuous score for downstream
  consumers (e.g. AL acquisition) without the boolean thresholding /
  warning emission of `OODGuard.check()`.
- Adds rotary position embedding (RoPE) modules to `phyiscsnemo.nn` and
  integrates support for 2D RoPE in the neighborhood attention backend
  of `DiT` layers.
- Adds support for RoPE, dynamic invalid-region masking, and a new
  `ConvDetokenizer` in `phyiscsnemo.models.DiT`. Invalid regions are supplied
  per forward call via the `invalid_mask` argument of `DiT.forward` (a
  per-sample, batch-variable pixel mask, domain-parallel safe), replacing
  flagged tokens with a learned mask token.
- Adds an inference script (`src/infer.py` + `conf/infer.yaml`) to the
  Unified External Aero Recipe
  (`examples/cfd/external_aerodynamics/unified_external_aero_recipe`),
  with integrated aerodynamic force/moment coefficients (`src/forces.py`:
  CD/CL/CS/CMR/CMP/CMY). The script is model/dataset-agnostic, writes one
  native `.pdmsh` `DomainMesh` per sample (carrying physical-unit
  `pred_<field>` / `true_<field>`), reports training-space metrics
  (matching the training/validation loop), and reuses the trainer's
  dataloader / collate / metric tooling (refactored into `datasets.py`
  and `utils.py`).
- Adds `physicsnemo.mesh.spatial.signed_distance_field`, a `Mesh`-typed
  wrapper over the Warp-backed `physicsnemo.nn.functional.signed_distance_field`
  op (CPU and CUDA), returning `(sdf, hit_points, hit_faces)` per query. The
  sign comes from Warp's angle-weighted pseudo-normal (robust at
  sharp/non-convex edges) or, with `use_sign_winding_number=True`, its
  generalized winding number (robust on non-watertight meshes).
  (Near-)degenerate faces, which the Warp mesh query would otherwise skip,
  are repaired into equivalent thin-but-valid triangles before the query.
  Supersedes and removes the private datapipes implementation
  (`physicsnemo.datapipes.transforms._sdf_torch` / `_sdf_triton`); the public
  datapipes SDF transform delegates here.
- Added an iterable style dataset to physicsnemo datapipes, for on-the-fly gpu simulations.
- DPS guidance now supports **non-uniform guidance strength**: the `std_y` and
  `gamma` arguments of `physicsnemo.diffusion.guidance.ModelConsistencyDPSGuidance`
  / `DataConsistencyDPSGuidance` and their
  `physicsnemo.diffusion.multi_diffusion` counterparts accept tensors as well as
  floats. A tensor assigns a different measurement-noise level / SDA scaling to
  each observation component, e.g. per-channel (`(1, C, 1, 1)`) or pointwise
  (full observation shape). Passing floats keeps the previous uniform
  behavior unchanged.
- Adds `relative_mse` and `relative_l2` (target-normalized regression errors,
  `relative_l2 = sqrt(relative_mse)`) to `physicsnemo.metrics.general`
  (`relative_error.py`), with optional element `weights` and `dim`-based
  reduction matching `general.mse`.
- `physicsnemo.metrics.general.mse` `mse`/`rmse` gain an optional `weights`
  argument for a masked/weighted mean (backward-compatible; `weights=None`
  reproduces the prior unweighted result).
- Adds a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) surrogate example
  (`examples/kinetic_monte_carlo`): a probabilistic autoregressive surrogate
  (`ParticleGeoTransolver`) that emulates a KMC event stream, predicting the
  next event (the new particle's features and inter-event delay) from the
  current particle population, an optional background mesh, and the simulation
  time. Independent rollouts form an ensemble for uncertainty quantification.

### Changed

- Splits the monolithic `physicsnemo.diffusion.noise_schedulers.noise_schedulers`
  and `physicsnemo.diffusion.samplers.solvers` modules into one module per class,
  named after the schedule or solver it defines, with the `NoiseScheduler` and
  `Solver` protocols in a `base.py` of their respective sub-package.
  Implementations are unchanged and every class is still re-exported from
  `physicsnemo.diffusion.noise_schedulers` and `physicsnemo.diffusion.samplers`,
  so the public import paths stay the same. The two old module paths remain as
  deprecated shims that re-export the same classes and raise a
  `DeprecationWarning` on import, so existing code keeps working. Import from
  `physicsnemo.diffusion.noise_schedulers` and `physicsnemo.diffusion.samplers`
  instead.
- `physicsnemo.nn.functional.signed_distance_field` now returns a 3-tuple
  `(sdf, hit_points, hit_faces)` — `hit_faces` is the int64 index of the
  triangle holding each closest point. Queries with no triangle within
  `max_dist` now return `NaN` distance/hit point and a `-1` face index
  (previously the out-of-band results were undefined: the kernel read from
  an uninitialized face index). Mesh-index range validation on CUDA inputs is
  now a device-side assert instead of a host-synchronizing check, so the op
  is safe on a sync-free prefetch stream; the eager `ValueError` is kept on
  CPU.
- Optimizes the production container build by consolidating related filesystem
  operations, using BuildKit bind and cache mounts, and separating custom,
  declared, and project dependency installation. Reduces total physicsnemo layers
  by around 78%.
- `GeoTransolver.forward`'s `return_embedding_states` and `return_point_features`
  are now keyword-only. They share a return signature, so a positional `True` did
  not say which was meant. Callers already passing them by keyword are unaffected.
- `ShardTensor.redistribute` now computes receive shapes analytically when
  sharding shapes are known, skipping the shape-negotiation `all_to_all`
  collective (falls back to the collective only when shapes are unavailable).
- PhysicsNeMo-Mesh tensor-valued gradients now consistently use the documented
  derivative-first layout `(entity, spatial_dimension, *value_shape)` across
  LSQ, intrinsic LSQ, and DEC. Earlier LSQ releases returned
  `(entity, *value_shape, spatial_dimension)` instead; migrate a stored legacy
  gradient with `legacy_gradient.movedim(-1, 1)`. Divergence and curl values
  are unchanged.
- xDeepONet `SpatialBranch`
  (`physicsnemo.experimental.models.xdeeponet.SpatialBranch`) now supports
  mixed-precision (AMP/autocast) training: FFT-based spectral convolutions are
  evaluated in float32 internally (cuFFT lacks complex-half support) while the
  rest of the branch uses autocast. This is a no-op under full precision, so
  fp32 outputs are unchanged. Also fixes a stale module docstring that
  referenced removed trunk/MLP-branch builder helpers.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.remeshing.remesh` now raises `NotImplementedError` for
  non-2D-in-3D inputs (the remeshing implementation is surface-only) instead
  of failing confusingly downstream, and its docstring reflects that
  restriction.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.spatial`: `BVH.from_mesh` and `ClusterTree.from_points` now
  share a single morton-LBVH node-topology builder (`spatial/_lbvh.py`),
  removing ~80 lines of duplicated build logic; construction output is
  byte-identical. `BVH.from_mesh` now defaults to `leaf_size=1` (was 8),
  matching `ClusterTree.from_points` and measured to be more performant across
  platforms (smaller leaves yield fewer candidate cells per query). Containment /
  nearest-cell query results are unchanged. Adds the first direct unit tests for
  `ClusterTree` (construction invariants, aggregates, dual-tree cover).
- `physicsnemo.mesh` performance: eliminated host-device syncs on hot paths.
  Cached topological adjacencies now store the `Adjacency` object directly instead
  of reconstructing it (which re-ran its syncing `__post_init__` validation) on every
  lookup — making cached adjacency lookups ~120x faster on GPU (~335us → ~3us for a
  10k-point sphere); the BVH leaf-hit expansion drops two per-traversal-level syncs;
  and the Laplacian smoother reuses its per-iteration buffers in place instead of
  reallocating them.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.Mesh.slice_cells` now accepts `None`/`Ellipsis` (keep all
  cells, return self), matching its type hint and `slice_points`;
  `gaussian_curvature_cells` reuses the cached `gaussian_curvature_vertices`
  property instead of recomputing it.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.Mesh` convenience methods now directly reuse shared
  canonical functions, removing duplicate implementation bodies and docstrings.
  This includes geometric, deformation (including radial-basis-function
  deformation), calculus, topology, visualization, and validation operations.
- `physicsnemo.mesh`: `draw` and `validate` are now the canonical standalone
  names matching `Mesh.draw` and `Mesh.validate`. The `draw_mesh` and
  `validate_mesh` remain as pending-deprecation compatibility names.
  `Mesh.validate` and `DomainMesh.validate` share the canonical validation
  option order, preserve the historical positional `tolerance` argument, and
  expose the new `check_self_intersection` option as keyword-only.
- `physicsnemo.mesh`: `validate(check_self_intersection=True)` now raises
  `NotImplementedError` (the check is unimplemented) instead of silently returning a
  `None` sentinel that masquerades as "no self-intersections found".
- `Mesh.strip_caches` and `DomainMesh.strip_caches` now accept a `keep`
  argument for retaining selected cache entries while clearing the rest.
  `Mesh.with_points` and `Mesh.with_cells` provide cache-aware coordinate and
  connectivity replacement for operations that preserve point or cell indexing,
  while data-only mesh transforms now preserve valid geometry and topology caches
  through `Mesh.with_data`.
- `physicsnemo.mesh` quality metrics now use a normalized
  aspect ratio of longest edge to minimum altitude. The metric is dimensionless and
  scale-invariant for simplices of every manifold dimension, and a regular
  simplex now has `aspect_ratio=1` and `quality_score=1`. This intentionally
  corrects the previous erroneous aspect-ratio and quality-score values.
- `Mesh.quality_metrics` and `Mesh.statistics` again use explicit property
  getters so their class-facing documentation describes argument-free property
  access. Configurable statistics tolerance remains available through the
  standalone `compute_mesh_statistics` function.
- Performance improvements in the diffusion module: reduced peak memory of
  DPS-guided diffusion sampling most notably for multi-diffusion at large
  domains. A guided `sample()` loop run under `torch.no_grad()` now detaches the
  state between solver steps, so the guidance autograd graph is no longer
  accumulated across the sampling trajectory (sampled outputs are unchanged;
  use `torch.no_grad()`, not `torch.inference_mode()`). Also expands CI test
  coverage and adds an API documentation page for
  `physicsnemo.diffusion.multi_diffusion`.
- Performance improvements in IO prefetching and GPU preprocessing in physicsnemo datapipes.
- &#9888;&#65039; **BC-impact (DPS guidance):** a custom `norm` callback passed to
  `physicsnemo.diffusion.guidance.ModelConsistencyDPSGuidance` /
  `DataConsistencyDPSGuidance` (and their `physicsnemo.diffusion.multi_diffusion`
  counterparts) must now return an **elementwise** loss (same shape as its
  inputs) instead of a per-batch-element reduced scalar of shape `(B,)`.
  Migration: drop the reduction from your `norm`, e.g. return
  `(y_pred - y_true).abs().pow(2)` rather than
  `(y_pred - y_true).pow(2).reshape(B, -1).sum(dim=1)`. For
  `DataConsistencyDPSGuidance` (and its `multi_diffusion` counterpart) the
  `norm` callback now also receives the **unmasked** `(x_0, y)` and the mask is
  applied to its output (`mask * norm(x_0, y)`), where it previously received
  the pre-masked `(mask * x_0, mask * y)`; the two agree for the built-in `Lp`
  norms, but a custom `norm` that relies on unobserved entries being zeroed
  before the call may differ. The integer `norm` selector (e.g. `norm=2`) is
  unaffected.
- `Mesh.transform` and `compute_cotan_weights_fem` now use the non-checking
  `torch.linalg.inv_ex` / `solve_ex` solvers, and build their index tensors on
  device. The checked solvers read a status code back to the host on every call,
  which synchronizes on CUDA; removing that and the index-tensor uploads takes
  `Mesh.transform` on a cached codimension-one mesh from three host
  synchronizations to one, and `compute_cotan_weights_fem` from six to three. As
  a consequence,
  `Mesh.transform(..., assume_invertible=True)` no longer raises when the matrix
  is in fact singular: it propagates NaN caches instead, as its docstring now
  documents. The default `assume_invertible=None` still tests the determinant
  and is unaffected.
- `physicsnemo.experimental.uq.VariationalGPHead` now takes `n_train` as a
  required keyword-only argument, along with every argument after `input_dim`.
  It was annotated optional while the constructor raised on `None`, so callers
  that already pass it by keyword are unaffected. It also gains `matern_nu`,
  which was previously hardcoded to 2.5 (still the default).

### Deprecated

- `physicsnemo.mesh.calculus.integrate_cell_data` and `integrate_point_data`
  are deprecated in favor of `integrate(..., data_source="cells"|"points")`.
  Compatibility wrappers remain available for this release and emit
  `LegacyFeatureWarning`.

### Removed

### Fixed

- `MeshReader` / `DomainMeshReader` sample discovery no longer uses
  `pathlib.Path.glob`, which can silently drop entries under filesystem
  metadata-server load (Lustre), causing training to proceed on a subset
  of the dataset.
- Unified external aerodynamics volume datasets now preserve in-file boundaries
  by default, so GLOBE can resolve `boundaries.vehicle` during collation.
  Point-based volume model templates explicitly opt into the existing
  boundary-dropping reader optimization.
- `compute_cotan_weights_fem`, and the calculus, curvature, and smoothing
  routines built on it such as `Mesh.laplacian`, no longer fail on degenerate
  cells in float32. The Gram-matrix regularization is now scale-free, so it also
  covers cells with no extent — including the null cells that `Mesh.pad` and
  `Mesh.pad_to_next_power` insert — and flat cells at large coordinate values,
  both of which previously raised a singular-matrix `_LinAlgError` from
  `torch.linalg.inv`. Weights for non-degenerate cells are unchanged bit for bit.
- Multinomial index sampling now uses one shared `weighted_multinomial`
  functional across datapipes, DoMINO, and remeshing. Its core API follows
  `torch.multinomial`, adds allocation-free integer input for uniform
  populations, and supports sampling with or without replacement. Exact
  sampling without replacement uses `torch.randperm` or a chunked exponential
  race, with an explicit low-memory Poisson-gap approximation for uniform
  sampling. This removes the `torch.multinomial` `2^24` category limit for
  sampling without replacement, consolidates duplicated Poisson index
  samplers, and fixes incorrect chunk-local indices and biased per-chunk quotas
  in DoMINO.
- Unified external aerodynamics recipe: the aggregate metrics reported for
  vector fields under the bare field name (e.g. `wss_l2`, likewise `_l1` /
  `_mae`) were computed on per-point vector magnitudes, so direction errors
  were invisible — a prediction with the correct magnitude but wrong direction
  at every point scored 0. The bare-name aggregate is now computed over all
  components jointly (whole-field relative norms, Frobenius for `l2`). The
  broken magnitude-only aggregate is not retained under a separate key.
  Per-component metrics (`wss_x_l2`, ...) were always direction-sensitive and
  are unchanged, and training/checkpoints are unaffected (the training
  objective goes through `LossCalculator`, not this metric path) — only
  reported aggregate vector metrics were misleading.
- Unified external aerodynamics recipe: model templates can now carry
  known-good training overrides (`train.yaml`'s `_self_` merges before the
  model template; all existing templates resolve identically). The GLOBE
  example now uses the recipe's default `compile` and learning-rate
  settings — both measured equivalent or better than the previously
  documented overrides on the DrivAerML surface case — and no longer sets
  `training.field_weights={pressure: 1.0, wss: 100.0}`, which was redundant
  with `NormalizeMeshFields` normalization and starved the pressure field
  of gradient signal (~2x worse converged pressure L2 at equal WSS L2).
- `ShardTensor` now survives `torch.compile` / AOTAutograd for tensor-subclass
  users: `__tensor_unflatten__` no longer forces `requires_grad` on the
  reconstructed inner (matching DTensor, so the inner/wrapper flags cannot
  disagree and trip `assert_metadata_eq` under a Dynamo graph-break re-fake),
  and `__coerce_same_metadata_as_tangent__` is subclass-friendly — it accepts a
  subclass's nested flatten context, treats empty and `None` sharding-shape maps
  as equal, and rebuilds a differing `ShardTensor`-subclass tangent via that
  type's own `__tensor_unflatten__` instead of returning `None` (the plain-tensor
  / `DTensor` cross-type `None` convention is preserved).
- `ShardTensor.to_local()` (and op-result forwards feeding it) is now
  differentiable under `torch.compile` / AOTAutograd. Previously the compiled
  backward was silently dropped (zero / missing gradient): ShardTensor's
  `__torch_function__` eager fallback converts to `DTensor` through
  `autograd.Function`s that AOTAutograd traces *through*, severing the primal's
  gradient connection during the joint trace. Under tracing, unpatched ops now
  pass through to `__torch_dispatch__` (mirroring `DTensor`, which defines no
  `__torch_function__`), keeping the graph differentiable while eager behavior
  and registered shard patches are unchanged.
- Datapipe contiguous-block subsampling now wraps cyclically, giving boundary
  and interior elements equal inclusion probability.
- Cell-subsampled GLOBE inputs now retain their effective integration measure,
  preventing area-weighted outputs and gradients from collapsing.
- `SetGlobalField` now writes injected fields to the domain-level `global_data`
  of a `DomainMesh`, in addition to the existing per-sub-mesh broadcast.
  Previously, code reading `DomainMesh.global_data` never saw the injected
  fields.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.io.from_pyvista(..., force_copy=True)` now copies attached
  point, cell, and global data as well as geometry. The matching new
  `to_pyvista(..., force_copy=True)` option prevents exported PyVista geometry
  and data from mutating the source `Mesh` through shared CPU storage.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.io.from_pyvista` now supports native line/poly-line grids,
  pixels, triangle strips, and pentagonal/hexagonal prisms, and selects explicit
  dimensions from mixed `UnstructuredGrid` inputs while preserving selected
  parent data. Explicit 1D conversion still derives the unique edge graph when
  no native lines exist. Connectivity and attached-data invariants are validated
  before VTK filters run. Unsupported higher-order topology is rejected pending
  globally conforming tessellation, while explicit vertex point-cloud conversion
  remains available without interpreting that topology. Centroid conversion
  rejects parents that cannot preserve cell-data alignment.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.sampling.sample_data_at_points` now handles integer and
  boolean fields by returning `float64`, so NaN sentinels and non-integral
  interpolation or multi-cell means are representable (subject to the usual
  `float64` precision limits). Point-data interpolation now promotes field and
  geometry dtypes consistently, and accumulation uses fewer full-sized
  temporaries and CUDA host synchronizations.
- `Mesh.point_data_to_cell_data` now handles integer and boolean point fields
  by returning `float64`, instead of raising `mean(): could not infer output
  dtype`. A mean of integers is generally non-integral, so it is computed in
  floating point (subject to the usual `float64` precision limits). This
  matches `Mesh.cell_data_to_point_data`, which already promoted discrete
  fields the same way; floating-point and complex fields are unaffected.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.projections.extrude` now produces a *conforming* (crack-free)
  simplicial complex for multi-cell inputs. Each prism was previously tessellated
  using the per-cell local vertex order, so adjacent cells that listed a shared
  edge's endpoints in different orders split the shared quad face along opposite
  diagonals; the resulting non-manifold volume leaked interior crack faces into
  `get_boundary_mesh` (boundary edges shared by 4 faces — e.g. an extruded L-shape
  or any multi-column grid, which also broke `repair.fix_orientation`). Parent-cell
  vertices are now sorted into a global order before tessellation (the
  Freudenthal-Kuhn subdivision), a no-op for already-sorted inputs.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.generate.marching_cubes` now accepts `bfloat16` fields by
  converting them to `float32` before crossing the NumPy boundary.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.projections.extrude` now returns consistently oriented cells
  for full-dimensional (codimension-0) output.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.remeshing.remesh` now preserves the input mesh's device and
  floating dtype instead of dropping them to CPU/float32.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.io.to_pyvista` now preserves supported dtypes for attached
  point, cell, and global data instead of narrowing every array to `float32`.
  Reduced-precision floating-point values are promoted only as needed for VTK.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.io.from_pyvista` and `to_pyvista` now preserve `float64`
  point coordinates instead of unconditionally narrowing geometry to `float32`,
  which could collapse small features on meshes with large coordinate offsets.
  Existing `float32` geometry remains `float32`.
- `physicsnemo.mesh`: `Mesh.to(<float dtype>)` and `DomainMesh.to(<float dtype>)`
  raised `TypeError: cells must have an int-like dtype` because the cast was applied
  to the integer `cells` tensor. A floating/complex dtype is now applied only to
  floating tensors; the integer `cells` (and any integer data) are preserved. Device
  moves are unchanged.
- `physicsnemo.mesh`: fixed several silent-wrong-result bugs — `slice_cells`
  carried stale point-level and non-local (`gaussian_curvature`) caches onto the
  sliced mesh; the intrinsic LSQ gradient returned all-zeros for codimension >= 2
  manifolds (now estimates the tangent space via local PCA); `smooth_laplacian`
  returned stale geometry caches after its in-place point update; `transform`
  propagated an incorrect point-normals cache under anisotropic/shear maps; and the
  derived-mesh methods (`compute_point_derivatives`, `compute_cell_derivatives`,
  `cell_data_to_point_data`, `point_data_to_cell_data`) aliased the source mesh's
  mutable `_cache`.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.spatial.ClusterTree.compute_source_aggregates` now
  normalizes with its call-time area weights instead of the weights used when
  constructing the tree, preserving correct aggregates when weights change.
- `physicsnemo.mesh`: fixed crash / data-integrity bugs — `project(...)` with
  `transform_point_data`/`transform_cell_data=True` mutated the input mesh in
  place; visualization and `to_pyvista` crashed on autograd-tracked tensors (now
  detached before `.numpy()`); and integer/bool data crashed (`safe_eps` on an
  integer dtype) or truncated via integer division during facet/scatter
  aggregation (now computed in a floating dtype).
- `physicsnemo.mesh` Morton-code quantization now handles empty inputs, tiny
  extents, half-precision coordinates, and one-dimensional endpoints correctly.
- `physicsnemo.mesh`: fixed Loop subdivision pulling open boundaries inward (now
  applies the boundary/crease mask); subdivision zero-filling integer/bool
  `point_data` at new edge vertices (now inherits a parent label);
  non-deterministic orientation flips and over-counted component sizes in
  `repair.fix_orientation`; random point sampling drawing barycentric weights in
  float32 for float64 meshes; and `Mesh.merge` not validating `point_data` /
  `global_data` key consistency.
- Fixed `DefaultTrainingLoop` reading `DistributedManager.device` at the class
  level (a `property` descriptor) instead of `DistributedManager().device`, which
  left the loop's device set to a `property` object under an initialized
  `DistributedManager` (`physicsnemo/active_learning/loop.py`).
- Replaced three plain-string regex / docstring literals containing invalid
  escape sequences with raw-string equivalents
  (`physicsnemo/utils/logging/launch.py`,
  `physicsnemo/metrics/general/calibration.py`,
  `physicsnemo/metrics/general/crps.py`); these were `SyntaxWarning`s today
  and become `SyntaxError`s in Python 3.16.
- Various test cleanups to remove self-inflicted warnings in CI output:
  disabled pytest collection for `TestModelA`/`TestModelB` helpers in
  `test/core/test_registry.py` via `__test__ = False`; migrated
  `test/nn/module/test_interpolation.py` to call the non-deprecated
  `grid_to_point_interpolation` and added a dedicated test for the
  deprecation alias; scoped a `lr_scheduler.step()`-before-`optimizer.step()`
  `UserWarning` filter to a single test in
  `test/optim/test_combined_optimizer.py`; guarded the
  `DistributedManager.initialize()` calls in `test/utils/test_checkpoint.py`
  with `is_initialized()`; and suppressed the import-time
  `ExperimentalFeatureWarning` in `test/datapipes/healda/test_features.py`
  via `warnings.catch_warnings()`.
- Fixed `physicsnemo.utils.get_checkpoint_dir` returning paths with `\`
  separators on Windows (e.g. `.\checkpoints_model`), which was inconsistent
  with the `/`-based paths used elsewhere in the checkpoint utilities and
  broke the `test_get_checkpoint_dir` CI test on Windows. The function now
  always joins with `/`, working uniformly for local paths and `fsspec`
  URIs (`msc://`, etc.) across operating systems.

### Security

### Dependencies

- Raises the minimum TensorDict version to `tensordict[zarr]>=0.14.0`,
  restoring the stable `tensordict` distribution while retaining Zarr support
  and upstream bug fixes.
- Removes `pyacvd` from the `mesh-extras` optional dependencies. Remeshing now
  uses NVIDIA Warp.
- Updates the minimum supported `warp-lang` version to 1.14.0.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Adds GLOBE model (`physicsnemo.experimental.models.globe.model.GLOBE`),
  including new variant that uses a dual tree traversal algorithm to reduce the
  complexity of the kernel evaluations from O(N^2) to O(N).
- Adds GLOBE AirFRANS example case (`examples/cfd/external_aerodynamics/globe/airfrans`)
- Adds GLOBE DrivAerML example case (`examples/cfd/external_aerodynamics/globe/drivaer`)
- Adds drop-test dynamics recipe.
- Adds concrete dropout uncertainty quantification for GeoTransolver. Learnable
  per-layer dropout rates enable MC-Dropout inference for uncertainty
  estimates. Disabled by default (`concrete_dropout: false`).
- Adds automatic support for `FSDP` and/or `ShardTensor` models in checkpoint save/load
  functionality
- PhysicsNeMo-Mesh now supports conversion from PyVista/VTK/VTU meshes that may
  contain polyhedral cells.
- In PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, adds `Mesh.to_point_cloud()`, `.to_edge_graph()`, and
  `.to_dual_graph()` methods. These allow Mesh conversion to 0D point clouds, 1D
  edge graphs, and 1D dual graphs, respectively, when connectivity information
  is not needed.
- Adds `physicsnemo.mesh.generate` subpackage with `marching_cubes` for
  isosurface extraction from 3D scalar fields, returning a `Mesh` object.
  Supports the NVIDIA Warp backend.
- Adds a type system to PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, allowing annotation of Mesh dimensions
  using notation like `Mesh[2, 3]` for a 2D manifold in 3D space.
- Adds adjacency caching to PhysicsNeMo-Mesh `Mesh` objects, allowing efficient
  reuse of neighbor information.
- Adds `DomainMesh` class for grouping an interior mesh with named boundary
  meshes and domain-level metadata, with passthrough geometric transforms
  (translate, rotate, scale, transform) and data operations.
- Allows selective per-field transformation of `Mesh` objects: `transform_point_data`,
  `transform_cell_data`, and `transform_global_data` now accept `bool | TensorDict`
  (or plain `dict` for convenience).
- Adds `physicsnemo.mesh.remeshing` subpackage with `partition_cells()` for
  creating Voronoi regions around seed points. BVH-accelerated.
- Added support for 1D, 2D, and 3D neighborhood attention (natten) via
  `physicsnemo.nn.functional` interface, with full `ShardTensor` support.
- Added derivative functionals in `physicsnemo.nn.functional` for
  `uniform_grid_gradient`, `rectilinear_grid_gradient`,
  `spectral_grid_gradient`, `meshless_fd_derivatives`, `mesh_lsq_gradient`,
  and `mesh_green_gauss_gradient`.
- Adds `physicsnemo.sym` module for symbolic PDE residual computation
  (`PhysicsInformer`). Users define PDEs via SymPy and select a gradient method
  (`autodiff`, `finite_difference`, `spectral`, `meshless_finite_difference`,
  `least_squares`); spatial derivatives are computed automatically using the
  `nn.functional.derivatives` functionals.
- Ports all physics-informed examples (LDC PINNs, Darcy, Stokes MGN, DoMINO,
  datacenter, xaeronet, MHD/SWE PINO) to the new `physicsnemo.sym` interface,
  replacing the separate `physicsnemo-sym` package dependency. Geometry is now
  handled via `physicsnemo.mesh` and PyVista.
- Added geometry functionals in `physicsnemo.nn.functional` for
  `mesh_poisson_disk_sample`, `mesh_to_voxel_fraction`, and
  `signed_distance_field`.
- Added rendering functionals in `physicsnemo.nn.functional` for isosurface,
  mesh, volume, LIC, point cloud, wireframe, and RGBA transfer rendering, with
  Warp kernels for rendering and PyTorch fallbacks for transfer functions.
- Adds embedded OOD guardrail `OODGuard` at
  `physicsnemo.experimental.guardrails.embedded`, optionally
  wired into `GeoTransolver` via a new `guard_config` constructor argument.
  The guard calibrates per-channel global bounds and a geometry-latent
  kNN threshold during training, and emits warnings on out-of-distribution
  inputs at inference.
- In PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, `physicsnemo.mesh.geometry` now publicly exposes
  `stable_angle_between_vectors` and `compute_triangle_angles` (previously
  only available via the private `physicsnemo.mesh.curvature._utils`).
- PhysicsNeMo Datapipes enables reproducability through `torch.generator`
  utilities.
- PhysicsNeMo Datapipes now supports `physicsnemo.mesh.Mesh` and
  `physicsnemo.mesh.DomainMesh` objects for deserialization, with
  transformations and utilities for mesh-based datasets.
- PhysicsNeMo Datapipes now support `MultiDataset` construction,
  allowing on-the-fly construction of multi-source composite datasets
  that can be sampled and processed efficiently and coherently
  as one dataset.
- PhysicsNeMo Datapipes also support random augmentations for
  mesh-based datapipes, leveraging `torch.distributions` for
  broad random distribution support. Mesh and DomainMesh
  datasets allow random translation, scaling, and rotation
  of mesh data in coherent ways, compatible with reproducability
  features of physicsnemo datapipes.
- Adds a new *unified* training recipe for external aerodynamics
  that supports training on multiple datasets (DrivaerML, ShiftSUV,
  HighLiftAeroML, or more, bring your own, mix and match), supports
  training several different models (Domino, Transolver, GeoTransolver,
  Flare, GeoTransolver with Flare-attention, bring your own!).  Leverages
  mesh datasets and non-dimensionalization to enable dataset mixing and
  matching at runtime.  Train with surface or volume data.
- Adds a new `physicsnemo.diffusion.multi_diffusion` subpackage that
  scales 2D diffusion models to large domains via patch-based training
  and inference. Provides `MultiDiffusionModel2D` (wraps a base model and
  handles state patching, conditioning preprocessing, positional-embedding
  injection, and per-patch output fusion), the
  `MultiDiffusionMSEDSMLoss` / `MultiDiffusionWeightedMSEDSMLoss` losses
  for patch-based DSM training, and `MultiDiffusionPredictor` for
  sampling (plugs straight into `sample()` / `get_denoiser()` and the
  standard solvers). Patching primitives (`BasePatching2D`,
  `GridPatching2D`, `RandomPatching2D`) are exposed under the same
  subpackage and are `torch.compile`-friendly with `fullgraph=True`.
  `MultiDiffusionPredictor` supports memory-efficient inference on
  large domains via `chunk_size` and `use_checkpointing`. The
  subpackage also ships patch-local DPS guidance:
  `MultiDiffusionDPSScorePredictor` (drop-in score predictor that plugs
  into the standard sampling stack),
  `MultiDiffusionDataConsistencyDPSGuidance` for inpainting and sparse
  data assimilation, and `MultiDiffusionModelConsistencyDPSGuidance` for
  generic patch-local observation operators. Use these instead of the
  global `DPSScorePredictor` to run guided sampling on domains that
  would otherwise OOM.
- Adds `"epsilon"` as a supported prediction type throughout the diffusion
  framework, alongside the existing `"x0"` and `"score"` modes. A new
  `PredictorType = Literal["x0", "score", "epsilon"]` alias in
  `physicsnemo.diffusion.base` is wired through losses (`MSEDSMLoss`,
  `WeightedMSEDSMLoss`, and the multi-diffusion losses), preconditioners,
  samplers / solvers, DPS guidance, and noise schedulers, enabling
  end-to-end training and sampling of epsilon-parameterized models.
  Losses gain an `epsilon_to_x0_fn` kwarg used for the epsilon-to-x0
  conversion required during DSM training.
- Adds `DiffusionUNet3D` 3D U-Net diffusion backbone for volumetric data at
  `physicsnemo.experimental.models.diffusion_unets`. Implements the
  `DiffusionModel` protocol. Exposes reusable 3D building blocks
  (`Conv3D`, `GroupNorm3D`, `UNetAttention3D`, `UNetBlock3D`) at
  `physicsnemo.experimental.nn`.
- Added support for Batched radius search, which enables Domino
  and GeoTransolver with local features and batch size > 1.
- Added the underfill recipe.

### Changed

- Improved crash recipe with configurable stats directory.
- `physicsnemo.mesh.sampling.find_nearest_cells` uses a KNN-backed
  implementation, and no longer accepts the `bvh=`, `chunk_size=`,
  `max_rounds=`, or `max_candidates_per_point=` parameters.
- &#9888;&#65039; **BC-impact (deep imports):** internal `physicsnemo.nn.functional`
  modules were reorganized by category. Public top-level functional imports are
  unchanged, but code importing internal module paths directly (for example
  `physicsnemo.nn.functional.knn` or
  `physicsnemo.nn.functional.radius_search`) should migrate to
  `physicsnemo.nn.functional.neighbors.*`.
- Consolidated Warp interpolation kernels for grid-to-point and point-to-grid
  backends, and added missing kernel/helper docstrings.
- In PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, dual-mesh primitives gained closed-form fast paths
  for triangle meshes embedded in 3D. `compute_circumcenters` is up to
  ~10000x faster (e.g. 11 s -> ~1 ms on a 360 K-triangle AirFRANS mesh,
  RTX 4090) by replacing batched `torch.linalg.lstsq` over (2, 3) systems
  with a closed-form cross product, and `compute_vertex_angles` is up to
  ~15x faster on the same meshes by replacing the dimension-agnostic
  Gram-determinant formula with an `atan2(||cross||, dot)` formulation.
  Anything that depends on these (Gaussian curvature, FEM Laplacian,
  cotangent weights, Voronoi areas, smoothing) inherits the speedup. See
  `perf.md` for the full audit.
- In PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, BVH construction is faster on GPU.
  `_compute_morton_codes` has a CUDA-specific fused-bits path that
  eliminates the `n_bits` sequential kernel launches of the previous
  bit-loop (5-8x speedup on small / medium meshes), and `BVH.from_mesh`
  reuses the cached `Mesh.cell_centroids` instead of recomputing.
  End-to-end `BVH.from_mesh` is ~2x faster on a 162 K-tet `cube_volume`
  mesh.
- In PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, the topology-dedup APIs
  (`categorize_facets_by_count`, `find_edges_in_reference`,
  `remove_duplicate_cells`, `build_adjacency_from_pairs`) gained optional
  `index_bound` / `n_targets` parameters. When the caller passes a strict
  upper bound (typically `mesh.n_points` or `mesh.n_cells`), the implicit
  `tensor.max().item()` GPU sync is avoided and the dedup uses a packed
  int64 unique (via the new internal `unique_index_tuples`) and a single
  composite-key argsort. End-to-end `get_boundary_edges` and
  `cell_to_cells_adjacency` are ~2x faster on practical-size unstructured
  meshes (e.g. 360 K-triangle AirFRANS).
- &#9888;&#65039; **BC-impact (deep imports):** in PhysicsNeMo-Mesh,
  `stable_angle_between_vectors` and `compute_triangle_angles` moved from
  `physicsnemo.mesh.curvature._utils` to `physicsnemo.mesh.geometry._angles`.
  The old private path is no longer available; use the
  `physicsnemo.mesh.geometry` re-export instead.
- &#9888;&#65039; **BC-impact (pre-release rename):** in PhysicsNeMo-Mesh,
  `DomainMesh.apply` was renamed to `DomainMesh.apply_to_meshes`. The
  original name shadowed the recursive `Tensor -> Tensor` `apply` method
  that `@tensorclass` auto-injects, breaking duck-type symmetry with
  `Mesh.apply` for any code that handled both classes. After the rename,
  `dm.apply(tensor_fn)` works as expected (recurses through every leaf
  tensor in `interior`, `boundaries`, and `global_data`); the original
  Mesh-to-Mesh broadcast is now `dm.apply_to_meshes(mesh_fn)`. Early
  adopters of the unreleased `DomainMesh` API should rename their
  `.apply(...)` callsites to `.apply_to_meshes(...)`.
- Refactored the patching utilities under
  `physicsnemo.diffusion.multi_diffusion.patching`. Patching and fusion
  operations are now more performant and `torch.compile`-friendly (e.g.
  `fullgraph=True`,`error_on_recompile=True`).
- Refactored the `examples/geophysics/diffusion_fwi` full-waveform
  inversion example to use the consolidated `physicsnemo.diffusion` API
  (preconditioners, samplers, losses, DPS guidance) and removed the
  recipe-local copies of these utilities under `utils/`.
- Refactored the `examples/generative/topodiff` recipe to use the
  consolidated `physicsnemo.diffusion` API (`MSEDSMLoss` with
  `prediction_type="epsilon"`, `sample()`, `DPSScorePredictor`) plus a
  recipe-local DDPM scheduler, solver, and classifier guidance. Removed
  the now-unused `Diffusion`, `DatasetTopoDiff`, and `load_data_topodiff`
  abstractions from `physicsnemo.models.topodiff`.
- Significantly expanded CI test coverage for `physicsnemo.diffusion`,
  including new tests for samplers, solvers, preconditioners, losses,
  DPS guidance, multi-diffusion, and patching utilities, plus
  combined-workflow and from-checkpoint round-trip tests. Most tests
  run with `fullgraph=True` and `error_on_recompile` to catch
  `torch.compile` regressions.
- Internal weight initialization in the distributed AFNO layers and the
  `EarthAttention` blocks of `physicsnemo.nn.module.attention_layers` now
  dispatches to `torch.nn.init.trunc_normal_` directly instead of going
  through frozen in-tree copies of the pre-PyTorch-2.12 inverse-CDF
  implementation. PyTorch 2.12 reimplemented `trunc_normal_` as a
  rejection-sampling loop on top of `normal_()` (see
  [pytorch/pytorch#174997](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/174997)),
  so seeded from-scratch initialization consumes the RNG stream
  differently on 2.12+ vs older versions. Existing trained checkpoints
  are unaffected (loading bypasses init). Forward-accuracy reference
  outputs for `AFNO`, `ModAFNO`, `Transolver`, `FLARE`, and `Pangu` were
  regenerated against the new algorithm. Rather than wiring per-model
  skips, `test.common.validate_forward_accuracy` now uniformly skips on
  `torch < 2.12` (the reference data is locked to that floor via a single
  `_REFERENCE_DATA_MIN_TORCH` constant; bump it when a PyTorch
  release next changes an init/RNG algorithm any forward-accuracy model
  depends on, and regenerate the `.pth` files at the same time).

### Deprecated

- `physicsnemo.utils.mesh` is deprecated and will be removed in v2.2.0. For
  isosurface extraction, use `physicsnemo.mesh.generate.marching_cubes` instead
  of `sdf_to_stl`. For VTP/OBJ/STL file conversion (`combine_vtp_files`,
  `convert_tesselated_files_in_directory`), use VTK or PyVista directly.
- `physicsnemo.nn.module.utils.trunc_normal_` (and its submodule path
  `physicsnemo.nn.module.utils.weight_init.trunc_normal_`) is deprecated
  and will be removed in v2.2.0. It is now a thin wrapper around
  `torch.nn.init.trunc_normal_` that emits a `DeprecationWarning` on
  call, replacing the frozen in-tree copy of the legacy inverse-CDF
  implementation. Use `torch.nn.init.trunc_normal_` directly.
- Deprecates the CorrDiff example (`examples/weather/corrdiff`), which no longer
  receives maintenance, bug fixes, or new features. Use the regional
  high-resolution weather model example (`examples/weather/stormcast`) instead.
  That example unifies regional diffusion-based weather models, and covers the
  CorrDiff downscaling setting alongside other diffusion-based settings.

### Removed

- The legacy in-tree `trunc_normal_` implementation that lived in
  `physicsnemo/models/afno/distributed/layers.py` (`_trunc_normal_` /
  `_no_grad_trunc_normal_`) is removed. These names were private; all
  in-tree call sites now use `torch.nn.init.trunc_normal_`.

### Fixed

- Fixed functional benchmark plot fallback labeling so unlabeled ASV results use
  the same key ordering as the benchmark runner.
- Fixed graph break caused by `FunctionSpec` dispatch (`max(key=)` is not supported by `torch.compile`)
- Fixed bug in Pangu, FengWu attention window shift for asymmetric longitudes
- Fixed a bug in `mesh.sampling.find_nearest_cells`, where a mixup between L2 and L-inf norms
  could cause slightly incorrect nearest-neighbor assignments in highly skewed meshes.
- Fixed TensorDict key-ordering bug in GLOBE's Barnes-Hut kernel that caused
  incorrect results when `tensordict >= 0.12` reordered leaves during
  TensorDict construction from dict literals mixing plain and nested keys.
- In PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, `from_pyvista` now correctly handles
  `UnstructuredGrid` inputs in newer `pyvista` versions, looking up
  cell-type buckets in `cells_dict` with `np.uint8(pv.CellType.X)` keys
  rather than the `IntEnum` value, and skipping non-numeric VTK arrays
  (strings, objects) when copying point / cell / field data into the
  `Mesh` `TensorDict`s instead of failing the conversion.
- In PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, the `Mesh` constructor now preserves data when
  `point_data` / `cell_data` / `global_data` are passed as a non-dict
  `Mapping` (notably PyVista's `DataSetAttributes`). Previously, with
  `tensordict >= 0.12`, the `@tensorclass(tensor_only=True)` auto-init
  silently wrapped such Mappings as `NonTensorData` and dropped every key,
  so e.g. `Mesh(cell_data=pv_mesh.cell_data, ...)` produced an empty
  `cell_data`. `Mesh.__post_init__` now detects this wrapping and unwraps
  the original Mapping before coercing to `TensorDict`. The `tensor_only`
  fast path is preserved, so internal Mesh constructions (slicing,
  transforms, `from_pyvista`) keep their full speed. Backed by new direct-
  construction regression tests, a `cell_data` / `global_data` memmap
  round-trip test, and a committed `.pmsh` golden fixture that locks the
  on-disk format against silent breakage in future changes.
- In PhysicsNeMo-Mesh, `safe_eps(dtype)` is now capped at
  `torch.finfo(dtype).eps`, which fixes a float16 corner case where the
  previous `tiny ** 0.25` floor exceeded machine epsilon and could
  corrupt fp16 mesh quantities. Ad-hoc `+ 1e-10` denominators in
  `smooth_laplacian` and `compute_quality_metrics` have been replaced
  with the dtype-aware `.clamp(min=safe_eps(dtype))` to avoid silently
  zeroing fp16 weights.
- Fixed a silent bug in loading state from checkpoint for
  FSDP-backed models with `use_orig_params=False` and channels last
  memory format.
- Fixed issues with physicsnemo.nn.functional's `radius_search` that
  caused crashes when used with torch.compile.
- Fixed the sinusoidal positional embeddings formula in `SongUNet` and
  `MultiDiffusionModel2D` so it now follows the standard `sin / cos`
  convention. Affected reference data was regenerated.
- Constructing a `Mesh` (or `DomainMesh`) inside a `torch.compile`-traced
  function no longer raises `AttributeError` / `KeyError` or silently
  produces wrong output. The breakage came from two regressions in
  `tensordict >= 0.12.0` (PR `pytorch/tensordict#1552`), where the
  `@tensorclass` init wrapper's bypass branch silently skipped both
  field-default normalization and `__post_init__` under
  `torch.compile`. We pin `tensordict < 0.12` until the upstream fix
  (`pytorch/tensordict#1708`, `pytorch/tensordict#1709`) ships, and add
  a regression test (`test/mesh/mesh/test_compile.py`) that constructs
  a `Mesh` inside `torch.compile` and reads cached properties, so the
  same bug cannot return on a future pin bump unnoticed.

### Dependencies

- Increments minimum viable PyTorch version to `torch>=2.5.0` to support FSDP better
- Upper-bounds `tensordict < 0.12` to avoid the `torch.compile` regressions
  in `tensordict >= 0.12.0` (see corresponding entry under Fixed).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- Refactored diffusion preconditioners in
  `physicsnemo.diffusion.preconditioners` relying on a new abstract base class
  `BaseAffinePreconditioner` for preconditioning schemes using affine
  transformations. Existing preconditioners (`VPPrecond`, `VEPrecond`,
  `iDDPMPrecond`, `EDMPrecond`) reimplemented based on this new interface.
- New `physicsnemo.experimental.nn.symmetry` module that implements building
  blocks that preserve 2D and 3D rotational equivariance using a
  grid-based layout for efficient GPU parallelization, and an emphasis on
  compact `einsum` operations.
- Flare attention support for both Transolver and GeoTransolver models.

### Changed

- PhysicsNemo v2.0 contains significant reorganization of tools.  Please see
  the v2.0-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md to understand what has changed and why.
- DiT (Diffusion Transformer) has been moved from `physicsnemo.experimental.models.dit`
  to `physicsnemo.models.dit`.

### Fixed

- Shape mistmatch bug in the Lennard Jones example

### Dependencies

- CUDA backend is now selected via orthogonal `cu12` / `cu13` extras rather
  than being hardcoded to CUDA 13. Feature extras (`nn-extras`, `utils-extras`,
  etc.) are now CUDA-agnostic and can be combined with either backend, e.g.
  `pip install "nvidia-physicsnemo[cu13,nn-extras]"`. When neither `cu12` nor
  `cu13` is specified, PyTorch is installed from PyPI using its default build
  (currently CUDA 12.8 on Linux). For development with `uv`, use
  `uv sync --extra cu13` (or `--extra cu12`) to select the backend.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-17

### Added

- Added mixture_of_experts for weather example in physicsnemo.examples.weather.
  **⚠️Warning:** - It uses experimental DiT model subject to future API changes.

  Accessible in `examples/reservoir_simulation`
- Added abstract interfaces for constructing active learning workflows, contained
  under the `physicsnemo.active_learning` namespace. A preliminary example of how
  to compose and define an active learning workflow is provided in `examples/active_learning`.
  The `moons` example provides a minimal (pedagogical) composition that is meant to
  illustrate how to define the necessary parts of the workflow.
- Added a new example for temporal interpolation of weather forecasts using ModAFNO.
  Accessible in `examples/weather/temporal_interpolation`.

### Changed

  `torch.nn.Module`s.
- Support passing custom tokenizer, detokenizer, and attention `Module`s in
  experimental DiT architecture
- Improved Transolver training recipe's configuration for checkpointing and normalization.
- Bumped `multi-storage-client` version to 0.33.0 with rust client.

- Ensure stream dependencies are handled correctly in physicsnemo.utils.neighbors
- Fixed the issue with incorrect handling of files with consecutive runs of
  `combine_stl_solids.py` in the X-MGN recipe.
- Fixed the `RuntimeError: Worker data receiving interrupted` error in the datacenter example.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-26

  subject to future API changes.
- Improved documentation for diffusion models and diffusion utils.
- Safe API to override `__init__`'s arguments saved in checkpoint file with
  `Module.from_checkpoint("chkpt.mdlus", override_args=set(...))`.

- Functionality in DoMINO to take arbitrary number of `scalar` or `vector`
  global parameters and encode them using `class ParameterModel`
- TopoDiff model and example.
- Added ability for DoMINO model to return volume neighbors.
- Added functionality in DoMINO recipe to introduce physics residual losses.
- Diffusion models, metrics, and utils: implementation of Student-t
  distribution for EDM-based diffusion models (t-EDM). This feature is adapted
  from the paper [Heavy-Tailed Diffusion Models, Pandey et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14171>).
  This includes a new EDM preconditioner (`tEDMPrecondSuperRes`), a loss
  function (`tEDMResidualLoss`), and a new option in corrdiff `diffusion_step`.
  &#9888;&#65039; This is an experimental feature that can be accessed through the
  `physicsnemo.experimental` module; it might also be subjected to API changes
  without notice.
- Bumped Ruff version from 0.0.290 to 0.12.5. Replaced Black with `ruff-format`.
- Domino improvements with Unet attention module and user configs
- Hybrid MeshGraphNet for modeling structural deformation
- Enabled TransformerEngine backend in the `transolver` model.

- Added a new example for external_aerodynamics: training `transolver` on
  irregular mesh data for DrivaerML surface data.
- Added a new example for external aerodynamics for finetuning pretrained models.

### Changed

- Diffusion utils: `physicsnemo.utils.generative` renamed into `physicsnemo.utils.diffusion`
- Diffusion models: in CorrDiff model wrappers (`EDMPrecondSuperResolution` and
  `UNet`), the arguments `profile_mode` and `amp_mode` cannot be overriden by
  `from_checkpoint`. They are now properties that can be dynamically changed
  *after* the model instantiation with, for example, `model.amp_mode = True`
  and `model.profile_mode = False`.
- Updated healpix data module to use correct `DistributedSampler` target for
  test data loader
- Existing DGL-based vortex shedding example has been renamed to `vortex_shedding_mgn_dgl`.
  Added new `vortex_shedding_mgn` example that uses PyTorch Geometric instead.
- HEALPixLayer can now use earth2grid HEALPix padding ops, if desired
- Migrated Vortex Shedding Reduced Mesh example to PyTorch Geometric.
- CorrDiff example: fixed bugs when training regression `UNet`.
- Diffusion models: fixed bugs related to gradient checkpointing on non-square
  images.
- Diffusion models: created a separate class `Attention` for clarity and
  modularity. Updated `UNetBlock` accordingly to use the `Attention` class
  instead of custom attention logic. This will update the model architecture
  for `SongUNet`-based diffusion models. Changes are not BC-breaking and are
  transparent to the user.
- &#9888;&#65039; **BC-breaking:** refactored the automatic mixed precision
  (AMP) API in layers and models defined in `physicsnemo/models/diffusion/` for
  improved usability. Note: it is now, not only possible, but *required* to
  explicitly set `model.amp_mode = True` in order to use the model in a
  `torch.autocast` clause. This applies to all `SongUNet`-based models.
- Diffusion models: fixed and improved API to enable fp16 forward pass in
  `UNet` and `EDMPrecondSuperResolution` model wrappers; fp16 forward pass can
  now be toggled/untoggled by setting `model.use_fp16 = True`.
- Diffusion models: improved API for Apex group norm. `SongUNet`-based models
  will automatically perform conversion of the input tensors to
  `torch.channels_last` memory format when `model.use_apex_gn` is `True`. New
  warnings are raised when attempting to use Apex group norm on CPU.
- Diffusion utils: systematic compilation of patching operations in `stochastic_sampler`
  for improved performance.
- CorrDiff example: added option for Student-t EDM (t-EDM) in `train.py` and
  `generate.py`. When training a CorrDiff diffusion model, this feature can be
  enabled with the hydra overrides `++training.hp.distribution=student_t` and
  `++training.hp.nu_student_t=<nu_value>`. For generation, this feature can be
  enabled with similar overrides: `++generation.distribution=student_t` and
  `++generation.nu_student_t=<nu_value>`.
- CorrDiff example: the parameters `P_mean` and `P_std` (used to compute the
  noise level `sigma`) are now configurable. They can be set with the hydra
  overrides `++training.hp.P_mean=<P_mean_value>` and
  `++training.hp.P_std=<P_std_value>` for training (and similar ones with
  `training.hp` replaced by `generation` for generation).
- Diffusion utils: patch-based inference and lead time support with
  deterministic sampler.
- Existing DGL-based XAeroNet example has been renamed to `xaeronet_dgl`.
  Added new `xaeronet` example that uses PyTorch Geometric instead.
- Updated the deforming plate example to use the Hybrid MeshGraphNet model.
- &#9888;&#65039; **BC-breaking:** Refactored the `transolver` model to improve
  readability and performance, and extend to more use cases.
- Diffusion models: improved lead time support for `SongUNetPosLtEmbd` and
  `EDMLoss`. Lead-time embeddings can now be used with/without positional
  embeddings.
- Diffusion models: consolidate `ApexGroupNorm` and `GroupNorm` in
  `models/diffusion/layers.py` with a factory `get_group_norm` that can
  be used to instantiate either one of them. `get_group_norm` is now the
  recommended way to instantiate a GroupNorm layer in `SongUNet`-based and
  other diffusion models.
- Physicsnemo models: improved checkpoint loading API in
  `Module.from_checkpoint` that now exposes a `strict` parameter to raise error
  on missing/unexpected keys, similar to that used in
  `torch.nn.Module.load_state_dict`.
- Migrated Hybrid MGN and deforming plate example to PyTorch Geometric.
