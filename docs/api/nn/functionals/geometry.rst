Geometry Functionals
====================

Point Displacement
------------------

.. autofunction:: physicsnemo.nn.functional.displace_points

.. code:: python

    import torch
    from physicsnemo.nn.functional import displace_points

    points = torch.tensor(
        [[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0], [2.0, 0.0]], requires_grad=True
    )
    displacement = torch.tensor(
        [[0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0]], requires_grad=True
    )
    point_weights = torch.tensor([0.0, 0.5, 1.0])

    moved = displace_points(
        points,
        displacement,
        point_weights=point_weights,
    )
    moved.square().sum().backward()

Sobolev Point Deformation
-------------------------

.. autofunction:: physicsnemo.nn.functional.sobolev_deform_points

.. code:: python

    import torch
    from physicsnemo.nn.functional import sobolev_deform_points

    points = torch.tensor(
        [[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0]],
        requires_grad=True,
    )
    cells = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 3]])
    displacement = torch.tensor(
        [[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.2], [0.0, -0.2], [0.0, 0.0]],
        requires_grad=True,
    )

    smooth = sobolev_deform_points(
        points,
        cells,
        displacement,
        length_scale=0.25,
    )
    smooth.square().mean().backward()

The operation assembles a P1 stiffness matrix and a uniform vertex mass scaled
by the mean positive lumped P1 mass. It solves
:math:`(M + \ell^2 K)u = Md` and returns :math:`x + u`.
``length_scale`` is :math:`\ell` in the same physical units as ``points``.
Zero recovers ordinary dense displacement. Larger values attenuate
short-wavelength changes in the raw displacement and its reverse-mode
sensitivity. The uniform mass makes this filter self-adjoint in standard
Euclidean vertex coordinates.

``fixed_points`` is an optional boolean vertex mask. True entries impose zero
Dirichlet displacement. Boundaries without a fixed mask use the natural
homogeneous Neumann condition. The Torch and Warp matrix-free solves support
one mesh or a batch of point tensors that share ``cells``. Both are
differentiable with respect to ``points`` and ``displacement``. The Warp
backend runs on CUDA and uses an explicit implicit-adjoint backward with an
analytic geometry vector-Jacobian product. CUDA segments, triangles, and
tetrahedra select Warp by default when it is available. CPU inputs and
higher-dimensional simplices select Torch. Positive length scales support
first-order reverse-mode differentiation. Higher-order derivatives are not
supported. The operation raises an error when a forward or adjoint solve does
not converge within ``max_iterations``. CUDA Graph capture is not supported
because P1 operator assembly and solver diagnostics are not capture-safe.
Warp CUDA results and point gradients may vary at roundoff between runs.

Sparse Control-Point Morphing
-----------------------------

.. autofunction:: physicsnemo.nn.functional.morph_points

.. code:: python

    import torch
    from physicsnemo.nn.functional import morph_points

    x = torch.linspace(0.0, 1.0, 9)
    points = torch.stack((x, torch.zeros_like(x)), dim=-1).requires_grad_()
    control_points = points.detach()[[0, -1]].clone().requires_grad_()
    control_displacements = points.new_tensor(
        [[0.0, 0.25], [0.0, -0.15]], requires_grad=True
    )
    radii = points.new_tensor([0.8, 0.8])

    morphed = morph_points(
        points,
        control_points,
        control_displacements,
        radius=radii,
        kernel="wendland_c2",
    )
    morphed.square().mean().backward()

This allows an optimizer—or a model producing the control displacements—to
learn a deformation from a differentiable objective on ``morphed``.

Global Radial-Basis Deformation
-------------------------------

.. autofunction:: physicsnemo.nn.functional.radial_basis_function_deform_points

.. code:: python

    import torch
    from physicsnemo.nn.functional import radial_basis_function_deform_points

    points = torch.tensor(
        [[0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25], [0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75]],
        requires_grad=True,
    )
    controls = torch.tensor(
        [[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0]],
        requires_grad=True,
    )
    control_displacements = torch.tensor(
        [[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0], [0.15, 0.25], [0.0, 0.0]],
        requires_grad=True,
    )

    exact = radial_basis_function_deform_points(
        points,
        controls,
        control_displacements,
        kernel="thin_plate_spline",
        polynomial=True,
        smoothing=0.0,
    )
    exact.square().mean().backward()

With zero smoothing and a nonsingular control layout, the fitted field
interpolates every control displacement up to solver precision. The affine
polynomial tail also reproduces affine displacement fields. A positive
``smoothing`` value adds diagonal regularization and relaxes interpolation.
Thin-plate-spline fields have global support, unlike the compact Shepard field
used by :func:`~physicsnemo.nn.functional.morph_points`. This formulation
follows the thin-plate-spline interpolant described by Bookstein [1].

Performance and Compilation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dense point displacement uses Torch on every device. Compact morphing and
radial-basis deformation use Torch by default on CPU and Warp by default on
CUDA. If Warp is unavailable, automatic CUDA dispatch falls back to Torch,
while explicitly requesting ``implementation="warp"`` raises an
``ImportError``.
For a repeatedly evaluated, fixed-shape CUDA deformation wrapped in
:func:`torch.compile`, benchmark ``implementation="torch"`` as well. Compiler
fusion can make that path faster after its one-time compilation cost. Keep the
backend explicit when comparing compiled and eager runs.

Compact morphing and radial-basis deformation evaluate every query/control pair.
Their computational cost is proportional to
``batch_size * n_points * n_controls * n_spatial_dims``. Pass all simultaneous
controls in one call. For a
:class:`~physicsnemo.mesh.domain_mesh.DomainMesh`, the object API combines its
interior and boundary queries into one field evaluation before rebuilding the
individual component meshes.

Radial-basis deformation additionally solves a dense control system with cubic
cost in ``n_controls``. Both backends use the same differentiable PyTorch solve.
``implementation="warp"`` selects a fused Warp evaluator for the point/control
evaluation phase. The checked coefficient solve is not supported inside CUDA
Graph capture. Use :func:`torch.compile` when compiled execution is needed.

For connectivity-preserving object APIs, use
:meth:`~physicsnemo.mesh.mesh.Mesh.displace`,
:meth:`~physicsnemo.mesh.mesh.Mesh.morph`, or
:meth:`~physicsnemo.mesh.mesh.Mesh.radial_basis_function_deform`. A
:class:`~physicsnemo.mesh.domain_mesh.DomainMesh` provides
:meth:`~physicsnemo.mesh.domain_mesh.DomainMesh.morph` and
:meth:`~physicsnemo.mesh.domain_mesh.DomainMesh.radial_basis_function_deform`
for shared sparse fields across all components.

Lattice Free-Form Deformation
-----------------------------

.. autofunction:: physicsnemo.nn.functional.free_form_deform_points

.. code:: python

    import torch
    from physicsnemo.nn.functional import free_form_deform_points

    points = torch.rand(1024, 3)
    control_displacements = torch.zeros(4, 4, 4, 3, requires_grad=True)
    origin = points.new_zeros(3)
    extent = points.new_ones(3)

    deformed = free_form_deform_points(
        points,
        control_displacements,
        origin=origin,
        extent=extent,
        basis="bernstein",
    )
    deformed.square().mean().backward()

With zero control displacements, the operation is exactly the identity, so a
lattice initialized at zero is a well-behaved starting point for shape
optimization. An optimizer, or a model that produces the lattice
displacements, learns the deformation from a differentiable objective on
``deformed``.

For repeated GPU calls, create ``origin`` and ``extent`` once as device tensors,
as shown in the example. Python sequences are convenient for one-off calls.
Each invocation with sequence inputs creates and transfers new tensors.

Choosing a basis:

- ``"bernstein"`` provides classic free-form deformation. Every lattice node
  influences every point in the box, which suits coarse design lattices. The
  polynomial degree, global support, and evaluation cost grow with the
  resolution.
- ``"bspline"`` uses uniform cubic B-splines with local four-node-per-axis
  support. The per-point cost is independent of the lattice resolution, so it
  scales to fine lattices for local sculpting and registration-style
  deformation. Along an axis with ``n``
  coefficients, index ``i`` is associated with the Greville coordinate
  ``(i - 1) / (n - 3)``. The first and last coefficient planes therefore lie
  one knot spacing outside the evaluation box.
- ``"linear"``, ``"cubic_hermite"``, and ``"quintic_hermite"`` use the two
  neighboring lattice nodes per axis and exactly reproduce every control-node
  displacement. ``"linear"`` is piecewise multilinear and C0 across cell
  boundaries. The cubic and quintic Hermite variants are C1 and C2,
  respectively. These modes suit design parameters whose values must be
  attained at the lattice nodes.

For ``"bernstein"``, the evaluation cost is proportional to
``batch_size * n_points * prod(resolution) * n_spatial_dims``. For
``"bspline"``, it is proportional to
``batch_size * n_points * 4**n_spatial_dims * n_spatial_dims``. The
node-interpolating modes use ``2**n_spatial_dims`` controls per point. Points
outside the lattice box remain unchanged. A sufficient condition for continuity
with a fixed exterior is to zero the outermost coefficient plane on every
Bernstein or node-interpolating face. For cubic B-splines, zero the first and
last three coefficient planes on every axis because three planes have nonzero
weight at each box face.

Eager Torch evaluation chunks query points to keep estimated live FFD
temporaries within 256 MiB. Under :func:`torch.compile`, the Torch backend uses
one vectorized block because symbolic chunk loops cannot be unrolled. The eager
memory budget is therefore not enforced. Very large Bernstein workloads may
require substantially more peak memory when compiled.

For connectivity-preserving object APIs, use
:meth:`~physicsnemo.mesh.mesh.Mesh.free_form_deform` or
:meth:`~physicsnemo.mesh.domain_mesh.DomainMesh.free_form_deform`.

Deformation Energies
--------------------

The deformation-energy functionals compare current point coordinates with a
fixed reference configuration and topology. They return differentiable penalty
objectives for use in an optimization loop. They do not solve a constrained
deformation problem or enforce hard constraints.

For a :class:`~physicsnemo.mesh.mesh.Mesh`, the wrappers in
:mod:`physicsnemo.mesh.deformation` validate and cache connectivity and build
triangle hinges automatically.

.. autofunction:: physicsnemo.nn.functional.simplex_strain_energy

.. autofunction:: physicsnemo.nn.functional.simplex_measure_energy

.. autofunction:: physicsnemo.nn.functional.total_measure_energy

.. autofunction:: physicsnemo.nn.functional.simplex_inversion_energy

.. autofunction:: physicsnemo.nn.functional.surface_bending_energy

.. autofunction:: physicsnemo.nn.functional.closed_surface_volume_energy

.. code:: python

    from physicsnemo.nn.functional import (
        simplex_inversion_energy,
        simplex_strain_energy,
        total_measure_energy,
    )

    loss = (
        simplex_strain_energy(points, reference_points, cells)
        + 40.0 * total_measure_energy(points, reference_points, cells)
        + 10.0 * simplex_inversion_energy(points, reference_points, cells)
    )
    loss.backward()

The simplex functionals accept unbatched ``(n_points, n_spatial_dims)`` or
batched ``(batch_size, n_points, n_spatial_dims)`` coordinates with shared
integer topology. Coordinates must use matching ``torch.float32`` or
``torch.float64`` dtypes. ``reduction="none"`` returns one value per simplex or
hinge. For ``total_measure_energy`` and ``closed_surface_volume_energy``, it
returns one global value per batch item. ``"sum"`` and ``"mean"`` reduce all
values to one scalar.

``simplex_measure_energy`` constrains each element separately, whereas
``total_measure_energy`` permits local redistribution and constrains only the
sum. Full-dimensional measure ratios retain the orientation relative to each
reference simplex. Embedded-simplex ratios are unsigned. The St.
Venant--Kirchhoff strain formulation used by
``simplex_strain_energy`` is reflection-blind. Add
``simplex_inversion_energy`` when full-dimensional simplex orientation matters.
Closed-surface volume requires one edge-connected, edge-closed, consistently
oriented 3D triangle surface. The low-level functional assumes that contract
without checking it. Surface bending is a geometric hinge regularizer rather
than a material shell model.

The tensor functionals validate topology shape, dtype, and device without
scanning index values, which would synchronize a CUDA device on every call.
Indices must therefore be distinct and in range as documented. Invalid index
values are outside the tensor API contract. Use the mesh wrappers when cached
value validation is needed. Direct tensor calls accept int32 or int64
connectivity, but normalize int32 connectivity on every call. Use int64 for
repeated direct calls. Mesh wrappers cache this normalization with the
topology.

Torch provides higher-order derivatives. Warp provides a first-order CUDA
path. Because its backward uses atomic accumulation at shared vertices, Warp
gradient results can have small run-to-run floating-point differences.

Nearest-Surface Shrinkwrap
--------------------------

Shrinkwrap projects each source point to the nearest location on a triangle
target surface. Optional point weights scale the displacement between the
source and projected positions. A signed offset moves the projection along the
selected target face normal.

.. autofunction:: physicsnemo.nn.functional.shrinkwrap_points

.. code:: python

    import torch
    from physicsnemo.nn.functional import shrinkwrap_points

    target_points = torch.tensor(
        [
            [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [1.0, 1.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
        ],
        requires_grad=True,
    )
    target_faces = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 3]])
    points = torch.tensor(
        [[0.25, 0.25, 0.30], [0.75, 0.75, 0.45]],
        requires_grad=True,
    )
    weights = torch.tensor([0.5, 1.0], requires_grad=True)
    offset = torch.tensor(0.02, requires_grad=True)

    wrapped = shrinkwrap_points(
        points,
        target_points,
        target_faces,
        point_weights=weights,
        offset=offset,
    )
    wrapped.square().mean().backward()

Source points use one of these shapes:

- ``(N, 3)``
- ``(B, N, 3)``

One triangle target is shared across the source batches. Keep the following
projection rules in mind:

- A positive ``offset`` follows target face winding.
- A finite ``max_distance`` leaves points at or beyond the cutoff unchanged.

Nearest-face selection, closest-feature changes, and distance gating are
discrete. Between those transitions, gradients propagate through the following
values:

- Source points
- Selected target vertices
- Floating-point weights
- A tensor-valued ``offset``

Target connectivity is not differentiable.

Torch provides the reference nearest-face search. Warp accelerates that search
on CPU and CUDA. Both backends evaluate the selected projection with PyTorch
in the input dtype. Exact ties at target edges or vertices can select different
adjacent faces. Their closest point is the same, but a nonzero face-normal
offset can differ.

Search backend rules differ by dtype and geometry:

- ``float64`` targets use the Torch search because Warp searches in ``float32``.
- Warp searches safe ``float32`` coordinates unchanged.
- Warp falls back to Torch for unsafe coordinate magnitudes or face geometry.

Shrinkwrap performs data-dependent validation and nearest-face search setup.
Do not run CUDA executions with either backend inside CUDA Graph capture.

For a connectivity-preserving object API and a triangle-panel example, use
:meth:`~physicsnemo.mesh.mesh.Mesh.shrinkwrap`.
