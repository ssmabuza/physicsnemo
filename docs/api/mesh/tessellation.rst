Tessellation
============

.. currentmodule:: physicsnemo.mesh.tessellation

Decompose non-simplicial cells into the simplices that the
:class:`~physicsnemo.mesh.mesh.Mesh` data structure stores. Currently this
provides triangulation of a *polygon soup* (:func:`triangulate`): a vectorized
vertex-0 fan for convex polygons and `ear clipping
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_triangulation>`_ for the rare non-convex
ones.

A *polygon soup* is a flat list of polygonal cells, each given only by its
vertex ring, with no shared-edge connectivity between cells -- the form a
surface mesh takes when read straight from a polygonal face list (e.g. a VTP or
STL file). Equivalently, it is a surface mesh whose cells may be arbitrary
polygons rather than triangles.

.. note::

   This is unrelated to the (now deprecated) ``Tessellation`` *geometry* class
   in PhysicsNeMo-Sym (``physicsnemo.sym.geometry.tessellation``), which
   represents a tessellated STL surface as a solid for sampling
   surface/interior points and signed-distance values. The utilities here
   instead split the polygonal cells of an existing mesh into simplices.

Handling non-convex polygons correctly matters for any unsigned-area-weighted
quantity (wall-shear / viscous force integration, or total wetted area): the
signed *vector* area of a vertex-0 fan telescopes to the polygon's total area regardless
of convexity, but the sum of the *unsigned* triangle areas does not.

Every ``k``-gon yields exactly ``k - 2`` triangles, so per-polygon data is
broadcast to the output identically in both paths using the returned
``parent_index``.

.. code:: python

    import torch
    from physicsnemo.mesh import Mesh
    from physicsnemo.mesh.neighbors import Adjacency
    from physicsnemo.mesh.tessellation import triangulate

    # A polygon soup as a cell-to-vertex Adjacency (CSR): one quad (vertices 0-3).
    points = torch.tensor([[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
                           [1.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]])
    polygons = Adjacency(offsets=torch.tensor([0, 4]),
                         indices=torch.tensor([0, 1, 2, 3]))

    # Low-level: triangle connectivity plus the parent-polygon index.
    cells, parent_index = triangulate(points, polygons)
    cells          # tensor([[0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 3]])
    parent_index   # tensor([0, 0]); broadcast data via cell_data[parent_index]

    # High-level: build a Mesh directly, broadcasting per-polygon cell data.
    mesh = Mesh.from_polygons(
        points, polygons, cell_data={"pressure": torch.tensor([2.5])}
    )

A :class:`~physicsnemo.mesh.mesh.Mesh` can also be constructed in one step with
:meth:`~physicsnemo.mesh.mesh.Mesh.from_polygons`.

Exact-Boundary Interior Filling
-------------------------------

Beyond decomposing existing cells, the package also *generates* quality
meshes. :func:`fill_interior` takes a closed codimension-one boundary
``Mesh`` and fills the enclosed interior with quality simplices. In 2D, the
boundary is an edge mesh forming one or more loops, in any order and
orientation. The algorithm resolves holes, multiple components, and
islands-inside-holes automatically through containment.

The algorithm uses constrained Delaunay triangulation
(Bowyer--Watson insertion with constrained-edge recovery, holes removed
topologically by even-odd parity flood fill) followed by Ruppert's
Delaunay refinement, so that every 2D output triangle *provably* satisfies
the requested minimum-angle bound and, optionally, a maximum cell size.

Optional optimal-Delaunay-triangulation (ODT) smoothing, controlled by
``smooth_iterations``, moves each interior vertex to the area-weighted
average of its incident triangles' circumcenters (Chen and Xu 2004). This
improves the *typical* angle while preserving both bounds. The
exact-boundary contract provides three guarantees:

- Every input vertex appears bit-identically in the output, in leading
  rows and input order.
- The pipeline only ever *subdivides* boundary facets and never moves
  them.
- The entire process is deterministic.

You can attach provenance fields (``"boundary_marker"`` and
``"source_point"``) to the output's ``point_data`` by setting
``provenance=True``. By default, the pipeline claims no keys in the
user-owned namespace.

The contract is dimension-generic by design. The ``n = 3`` case (a
watertight surface ``Mesh[2, 3]`` producing tetrahedra) currently raises
:class:`NotImplementedError`: exact 3D boundary recovery is a
substantially harder problem that requires its own implementation effort.
For implicit domains, or approximate volume meshing of a surface through
its SDF, refer to :func:`physicsnemo.mesh.generate.mesh_implicit_domain`.

.. code:: python

    import math
    import torch
    from physicsnemo.mesh import Mesh
    from physicsnemo.mesh.tessellation import fill_interior

    square = torch.tensor([[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0]])
    edges = torch.tensor([[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 0]])
    h = 0.1  # target interior edge length
    filled = fill_interior(
        Mesh(points=square, cells=edges),
        max_cell_size=math.sqrt(3.0) / 4.0 * h * h,
        min_angle_degrees=30.0,
        smooth_iterations=3,  # optional ODT smoothing
    )

:func:`polygon_interior_point` is a companion utility returning a point
strictly inside a simple polygon.
